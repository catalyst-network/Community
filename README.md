## How to Contribute

-  **Contribute code** - all Catalyst Network software is open source, so send us pull requests if you have any suggestions for ways the software can be improved

-  **Help with software testing** - we really appreciate and value our testers, and encourage people who want to support Catalyst Network to run the software and file issues in the appropriate repository for any bugs that are found. Read our [submitting bugs and suggestions guide](https://github.com/catalyst-network/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-reporting-guidelines)

-  **Improve the documentation** - we can never have enough documentation so if there's anything you'd like to clarify or add, just fork any of the Catalyst Network repos, start writing and expanding on the docs, and submit a pull request

-  **Organize community events** - we welcome anyone interested in putting together anything as simple as a meetup at a local library or community center to discuss the latest Catalyst Network developments and applications with like-minded people from your area

-  **Produce and share content** - if you have ideas or insights about Catalyst Network or decentralised applications in general, write a post and share it on Medium.
