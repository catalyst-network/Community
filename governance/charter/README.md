# Catalyst Governance Charter

## Core Values
<!-- Side note, would be cool to get some icons / art for these values for use on the website (Sam) -->
<!-- :+1: (Charles) -->

These are our core values, as voted by the maintainers, in order of importance. When in doubt, these should guide our decisions.

1. **Deliberate Inclusivity**

   We take the time to include all good-faith contributors.
   The project works around the lives of real people, and people shouldn’t sacrifice a reasonable livelihood to participate.

2. **Intellectual Safety**

   We work to cultivate and maintain an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing ideas and opinions without fear of harsh judgments or repercussions. We practice blameless analyses of our missteps.

3. **Transparency**

   We make our governance public whenever reasonable. By doing this, we are able to create a shared and sharable understanding of what we're trying to do.

4. **Accountability**

   People need a channel for safely communicating feedback to other maintainers.

5. **Shipping**

   We constantly strive to improve through iteration. Some ships will sink, so we build processes to accommodate expected failures as a safety net.

6. **Sharing**

   We seek to share knowledge of the project between maintainers. We share responsibilities and seek to meet objectives as a team.
