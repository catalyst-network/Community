Thanks for reaching out!

Because we treat our issues list as [the team's backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog), we close issues that are questions since they don't represent a task needing to be completed. For most questions about Electron there are a lot of options.
Check out the [Catalyst Community](https://github.com/catalyst-network/Community). There are also a bunch of helpful people on [Discord](https://discord.gg/anTP7xm) that should be willing to point you in the right direction.
